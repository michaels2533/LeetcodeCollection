# Question 13: Longest Common Prefix.

## Problem Description

    Write a function to find the longest common prefix amongst an array of strings.
    if there is no common prefix, return an empty string "".

## Example 1;

Input: strs = ["flower","flow","flight"]
Output: "fl"

## Example 2:

Input: strs = ["dog","racecar","car"]
Output: ""
Explanation: There is no common prefix among the input strings.

## Constraints

1 <= strs.length <= 200
0 <= strs[i].length <= 200
strs[i] consists of only lowercase English letters if it is non-empty.

## Reducing the prefix string approach.
